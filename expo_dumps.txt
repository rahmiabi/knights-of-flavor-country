In 2140 the Treaty of Pearis is signed between neighboring countries Malustan and Azurion, paving a way toward peace for the region.
Many are happy with the treaty, but some deeply oppose it.
Then in 2042 as tensions appeared to be easing, Lautenous, a Kernelian diplomat, is killed at the border between Malustan and Azurion.
Neither side claims the kill but blames the other.
Count Volodymr of Malustan is then removed from power and war erupts yet again.

Malustan strikes first hitting Azurion City.
In order to stop Malustan's advances further into the city, Azurion deploys Task Force Redmond.

Due to the efforts of Task Force Redmond and The Edge Operators, Malustan forces are driven out of Azurion City.
Azurion is now on the offensive and is now pushing Malustan back to the countryside.
Task Force Redmond is now tasked with assisting the push.

In order to break the stalemate between the two countries, Azurion has started launching covert attacks behind enemy lines.
Task Force Redmond is now tasked with taking out a factory that has been producing arms for Malustan.


//map4 final boss//
After pushing through the production zones of Malustan, Task Force Redmond ends up in the capital.
However, there does not appear to be anyone guarding it...
and it seems...
that you are...
in for a bad time...
