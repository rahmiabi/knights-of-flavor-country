  + ref image ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/halo/images/3/3c/New_Alexandria_3.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110224134513)

  + Where the evil surin fight happens

  + Then part 2 of the fight is against kernie

### tldr
+ Earth was peaceful until Malustan attacked. Their leader, Evil Surin, unleashed his Apple-engineered goons with m4 ultra chips the first 2 nm chip leading the charges.
+ We have to take out his lower-level goons, and after taking out his lower-level goons (m1-m2) you get the chance to take out an m3.
+ After taking out his 4 m3s you then get the chance to take evil surin.
+ However after Evil Surin is taken out, the goons keep attacking and it is then revealed that Evil Surin was actually a puppet created by Kerney the true mastermind behind the attack

### drake version (get it bc its long)
In 2122 tensions between Azuriona and Malustan are at a high. Lautenous a foreign diplomat from Kernelia is killed at the border of Azurion and Malustan and neither country wants to claim the kill, but both use it as a reason to attack each other. Which sparks the first war of ____.

In 2140 Volodymr becomes the new leader of Malustan and ends the war with the Treaty of Pearis bringing peace to both Malustan and Azurion.

In 2142 Kernie invests heavily in the VULCAN(Vanguard Ultra Lightweight Combat Armored Nanotech) program, which was a last-ditch effort to create a superweapon to end the stalemate between Malustan and Azurion. However, the program lost most of its funding due to the war being over.

In 2145 Kernie sells The HALO
