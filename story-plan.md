## Enemy Chars
+ M1
  + lore
    + Have to be controlled by a central M2 unit
  + Gameplay
    + Slow and swarmy, think zombies
  + Design
    + Honestly any generic "evil" robot works, but for ref here are some i think would look good (Helldivers 2 bots and terminator robots for ref)
      ![](https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/02/comissar-helldivers-2-56caf5a.png?quality=90&fit=700,466) ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/02/T-800_endoskeleton.png)
    
+ M2
  + Lore
    + Communicates with the M1s and takes commands from M3
  + Gameplay
    + Larger and more beefier than an M1 and does more damage
    + could be different types like helldivers 2 (ie rocket pod vers, meele/flame vers, and autocannon vers)
    + spawns less often
  + Design
    + Large and imposing like the hulks from helldivers 2
      1[](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/helldivers_gamepedia/images/e/e4/Helldivers-2-Automatons-Hulk.png/revision/latest?cb=20240419130609)
      
+ M3
  + Lore
    + Field commanders that take orders directly from M4 aka Evil Surin
  + Gameplay
    + Final boss of a level (think risk of rain 2 teleporter events)
      + Maybe option to spawn more just like ROR2?
    + Level 1 - city
      + Mix of meele and range attacks 
    + Level 2 - countryside
      + Range focused attacks and meeles that push you away
    + Level 3 - factory
      + Ranged attacks that stun and allow it to easily use its high dmg meele attacks without you being able to run (unless freed by friends)
  + Design
    + Would prefer that each is diffent from each other
    + Level 1 - city
      + Maybe a mid range fighter best suited for fighting along the city streets
      + Could look more like an enhanced super soldier or smth since it fights on the frontlines
    + Level 2 - countryside
      + Since this bot planned the attack from afar in the countryside, maybe they appear to be more of a war general rather than a fighter
      + Im kinda thinking svarog from Honkai star rail and most of his attacks would be perfect too
        ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/houkai-star-rail/images/d/d5/Enemy_Svarog.png/revision/latest?cb=20230501074730)
    + Level 3 - Factory
      + Due to the level being less open then the rest maybe this m3 is more meele focused and has a bunch of swords on it
      + Maybe a spider since it traps its prey and then goes for the kill
        
+ M4
  + Combination of all previous M3 mini bosses rolled into one full one
    
+ Kernie final boss
  + To make fun of kernie distain for bullet hell games, i think his attacks should mimic bullet hell games like imagine if the screen looked like this during gameplay
    ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/touhou/images/a/a0/SAextra001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110209052933)
  
+ Evil Surin
  + A puppet actor installed by Kernie using a backdoor
  + Being controlled or influenced by Kernie
+  Evil Kernie (Full Form): The mastermind of the war (Palpatine type beat)
  + Wants to control the world
  + After being defeated he goes on sabbatical

## Storyline

### Level list
+ 1) Azurion city under attack
  + Looks like new alexandria from reach
  + ref image (New Alexandria for ref)
![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/halo/images/3/3c/New_Alexandria_3.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110224134513)
+ 2) Outskirts of Azurion city more of a countryside
  + More wide-open
+ 3) Malustan factories
  + Closer quarters
  + Bombed out
+ 4) Malustan Capitol
  + Where the evil surin fight happens
  + happens in doors
  + roof caves in and kills him and reveals hes a puppet
  + Then part 2 of the fight is against kernie

### tldr
+ Earth was peaceful until Malustan attacked. Their leader, Evil Surin, unleashed his Apple-engineered goons with m4 ultra chips the first 2 nm chip leading the charges.
+ We have to take out his lower-level goons, and after taking out his lower-level goons (m1-m2) you get the chance to take out an m3.
+ After taking out his 4 m3s you then get the chance to take evil surin.
+ However after Evil Surin is taken out, the goons keep attacking and it is then revealed that Evil Surin was actually a puppet created by Kerney the true mastermind behind the attack

### drake version (get it bc its long)
In 2122 tensions between Azuriona and Malustan are at a high. Lautenous a foreign diplomat from Kernelia is killed at the border of Azurion and Malustan and neither country wants to claim the kill, but both use it as a reason to attack each other. Which sparks the first war of ____.

In 2140 Volodymr becomes the new leader of Malustan and ends the war with the Treaty of Pearis bringing peace to both Malustan and Azurion.

In 2142 Kernie invests heavily in the VULCAN(Vanguard Ultra Lightweight Combat Armored Nanotech) program, which was a last-ditch effort to create a superweapon to end the stalemate between Malustan and Azurion. However, the program lost most of its funding due to the war being over.

In 2145 Kernie sells The HALO
