### drake version (get it bc its long)
In 2122 tensions between Azuriona and Malustan are at a high. Lautenous a foreign diplomat from Kernelia is killed at the border of Azurion and Malustan and neither country wants to claim the kill, but both use it as a reason to attack each other. Which sparks the first war of ____.

In 2140 Volodymr becomes the new leader of Malustan and ends the war with the Treaty of Pearis bringing peace to both Malustan and Azurion.

In 2142 Kernie invests heavily in the VULCAN(Vanguard Ultra Lightweight Combat Armored Nanotech) program, which was a last-ditch effort to create a superweapon to end the stalemate between Malustan and Azurion. However, the program lost most of its funding due to the war being over.

In 2145 Kernie sells The HALO
